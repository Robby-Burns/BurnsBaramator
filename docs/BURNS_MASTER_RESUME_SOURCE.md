## COVER LETTER TEMPLATES

### Template 1: AI Product Manager (Platform / Infrastructure)

**Scenario:** Applying for Agent Platform PM, MCP, or similar infrastructure role at AI company

```
Dear [Hiring Manager / Team Name],

[HOOK: Reference specific role/company mission]

I'm applying for the [Role] position because I am living the exact developer experience you aim to optimize.

Over the past year, I've architected multi-agent systems for [project examples], and I know intimately the friction points your platform solves: standardized protocols for safe agent-tool interactions, human-in-the-loop workflows, and developer-facing APIs that hide complexity.

Building individual agents is straightforward. Integrating them safely at scale is the nightmare. [Specific example of friction point solved or not solved]. This is exactly the problem [platform name] solves.

What draws me to [Company] is [company-specific value: safety-first architecture, long-term thinking, etc.]. I spend most of my time building Docker sandboxes, approval workflows, and audit trails—not because regulators require it yet, but because that's how reliable systems are built. [Company]'s focus on [X] reflects the same principle.

My background blends 20+ years as an Operator and Builder:

**Operator (20+ years):** I've optimized complex systems (agriculture, brewery supply chains) where constraints matter more than raw capability. Optimize for capability without system health, and the system crashes. This philosophy aligns perfectly with [Company]'s approach.

**Builder (recent):** I completed my Master's in Data Science while building [multi-agent systems / RAG pipelines / safety frameworks], wrestling with the exact friction points your platform addresses. I'm now applying these skills in highly regulated environments where the stakes are high (hallucination = compliance violation).

[PROOF POINTS - choose 2-3:]
- Designed multi-agent orchestration patterns aligned with MCP concepts (capability routing, tool abstraction)
- Built evaluation frameworks measuring agent accuracy, safety guardrails, and reliability
- Engineered Docker-based sandboxing for secure code execution in regulated financial environments
- Implemented human-in-the-loop governance preventing auto-execution of high-stakes actions

While my 20+ years of PM experience comes from founding and scaling physical businesses rather than software platforms, the skills are deeply transferable: defining product vision, managing roadmaps, building teams, and iterating based on user feedback. What's different now is I've intentionally upskilled in AI/ML and I'm building the exact systems your platform aims to support.

I'm ready to bring that builder's perspective to your team, shipping infrastructure that makes safe, reliable agents the default, not the exception.

[Personalized closing]

Sincerely,
Robert Burns

### Template 2: Staff Engineer / AI Systems (Technical Role)

**Scenario:** Applying for Staff Engineer, Senior AI Engineer, or similar IC role at AI company

```
Dear [Hiring Manager],

I've shipped production AI systems that work in the real world, not just in notebooks.

[HOOK: Reference specific technical challenge company faces]

My background combines 20 years of operations leadership with intentional upskilling in AI/ML. The result: I'm comfortable building systems that are safe, observable, and maintainable at scale.

Over the past year, I've shipped:

- [Project 1: core technical achievement + impact]
- [Project 2: core technical achievement + impact]
- [Project 3: core technical achievement + impact]

What connects these projects isn't the specific technology stack; it's a philosophy: **Build for reliability and safety from the start, not as an afterthought.**

In practice, this means:
- Docker-based sandboxing for RCE mitigation
- Guardrails preventing hallucinations and enforcing business logic
- Human-in-the-loop approval for high-stakes decisions
- Semantic routing reducing context pollution and improving accuracy
- Immutable audit trails for compliance and debugging

I understand the constraints that companies face:
- Regulated environments (financial services) require 100% accuracy
- Non-technical users (elderly volunteers, fishermen) require accessible interfaces
- Budget-conscious organizations need vendor-agnostic architectures
- Scaling requires systems that don't inflate in complexity with growth

These aren't nice-to-haves; they're non-negotiables in production systems.

I'm looking for a role where shipping reliable, observable systems is valued as much as shipping features. I'd welcome the opportunity to discuss how my experience building production AI systems aligns with your needs.

[Personalized closing]

Sincerely,
Robert Burns

### Template 3: Operations / Business Leadership

**Scenario:** Applying for VP Ops, Director of Operations, or similar business leadership role

```
Dear [Hiring Manager],

I've proven I can optimize complex systems at scale—whether they're farms, breweries, or AI pipelines.

[HOOK: Reference specific operational challenge/metric company faces]

Over 20 years, I've repeatedly demonstrated a core principle: **Constraints matter more than raw capability. Optimize for system health, and growth follows.**

**In Agriculture (21 years):**
- Scaled managed acreage by 120% through process engineering, without proportional cost increase
- Cut chemical use by 40% through IoT-based optimization, improving both margin and environmental impact
- Built data infrastructure enabling predictive resource allocation

**In Brewing (10 years):**
- Built and led team of 10+, managing full P&L
- Implemented predictive inventory system reducing stockouts by 15%
- Shipped e-commerce platform driving 30% customer acquisition growth
- Proved that rapid iteration and real user feedback drive better products

**In Enterprise (recent):**
- Led AI/ML team at Dutch Bros, defining product requirements and roadmap
- Managed complex infrastructure projects ($400k+ savings on SASE)
- Introduced user-centric methods (personas, journeys, feedback loops) to engineering-first organization
- Built cross-functional teams managing data platforms, BI, and strategic initiatives

**Why This Matters for [Company]:**

I don't think of operations as "keeping the lights on." I think of operations as creating the conditions for sustainable growth. This means:
- Investing in process before scaling headcount
- Measuring what matters (business outcomes, not just metrics)
- Building teams that can articulate "why" not just "what"
- Maintaining flexibility when markets change

I'm looking for a role where operational excellence is valued as a competitive advantage, not a cost center.

[Personalized closing]

Sincerely,
Robert Burns

### Template 4: Product Management (Software / Startup)

**Scenario:** Applying for PM, Senior PM, or product leadership role at software/startup

```
Dear [Hiring Manager],

I've run products my entire career—just not always with the title "Product Manager."

As a founder/operator for 20+ years, I managed product portfolios (agricultural tools, brewery SKUs, internal data platforms) the way software PMs do: user research, roadmap planning, A/B testing, GTM strategy, data-driven iteration.

More recently, I shipped production AI systems for real customers:
- **FishCatch AI Agent:** Mobile-first system for commercial fishermen managing catch sales at sea
- **SVdP Grant Discovery:** AI system enabling elderly volunteers to discover and draft grant applications (80% time savings)
- **SVdP Marketing Platform:** Vendor-agnostic content automation system for non-profit storytelling
- **Legacy Code Documentation Agent:** LLM-powered system reducing documentation time from hours to seconds

Each of these projects reinforced the same lesson: **Great products come from rapid iteration, real user feedback, and letting data tell you when you're wrong.**

What I bring to [Company]:

1. **User Empathy:** I don't just talk about personas—I've built systems for fishermen, elderly volunteers, and financial analysts. Each required different approaches to accessibility and UX.

2. **Data-Driven Iteration:** From A/B testing beer recipes to measuring agent evaluation accuracy, I'm comfortable letting metrics guide decisions.

3. **Cross-Functional Leadership:** I've worked with engineers, designers, users, and stakeholders. I know how to translate between them.

4. **End-to-End Thinking:** I've built products, not just managed roadmaps. I understand what it takes to ship.

[PERSONALIZED ADDITION: Reference specific product, approach, or company value that resonates]

I'm excited about [Company] because [reason]. I'd welcome the chance to discuss how my experience building products across different domains can help you achieve [specific goal].

Sincerely,
Robert Burns
```
