## ✅ Resolved Bugs

### BUGS-R04: API Database Connection Failure
**Status:** Resolved
**Priority:** High
**Severity:** Major
**Found:** Feb 2026
**Fixed:** Feb 2026

**Problem:**
`api/index.py` failed because it used SQLite-specific methods (`cursor`, `fetchall`) on the new SQLAlchemy-based `DatabaseManager`. It also hardcoded `jobs.db`.

**Root Cause:**
Refactoring `db/manager.py` to SQLAlchemy broke the API endpoint which was still using the old SQLite pattern.

**Solution:**
Updated `api/index.py` to use `db.engine.connect()` and `text()` queries, and removed the hardcoded DB path to allow env var configuration (Neon/Postgres).

### BUGS-R03: Vercel "Externally Managed Environment" Error
**Status:** Resolved
**Priority:** High
**Severity:** Blocker
**Found:** Feb 2026
**Fixed:** Feb 2026

**Problem:**
Vercel build failed with `error: externally-managed-environment` when running `pip install -r requirements.txt`.

**Solution:**
Removed the explicit `buildCommand` from `vercel.json`. Since `pyproject.toml` is now populated, Vercel's default build process handles dependency installation correctly.

### BUGS-R02: Vercel Build Configuration Mismatch
**Status:** Resolved
**Priority:** High
**Severity:** Blocker
**Found:** Feb 2026
**Fixed:** Feb 2026

**Problem:**
Vercel deployment failed due to mismatch between `uv.lock` (Python 3.12) and `pyproject.toml` (Python 3.11).

**Solution:**
Updated `pyproject.toml` to include all dependencies and match runtime.

### BUGS-R01: Vercel Deployment Failure (ModuleNotFoundError)
**Status:** Resolved  
**Priority:** High  
**Severity:** Blocker  
**Found:** Feb 2026  
**Fixed:** Feb 2026  

**Problem:**
Vercel deployment failed with `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'fastapi'`.

**Solution:**
Populated `pyproject.toml` dependencies.

## 🔍 Bug Patterns Identified

### Pattern 1: Refactoring Regression
**Occurrences:** 1
**Components Affected:** API
**Pattern:** Changing the core DB manager broke downstream consumers (API) that relied on the old interface.
**Solution:** When refactoring core components, grep for all usages (e.g., `DatabaseManager`) and update them.

### Pattern 2: Vercel Build System Evolution
**Occurrences:** 3
**Components Affected:** Deployment
**Pattern:** Vercel's shift to `uv` and stricter environment management requires simpler configuration.
**Solution:** Rely on standard files (`pyproject.toml`, `requirements.txt`).

## ⚠️ Known Limitations (Not Bugs)

### Limitation 1: LinkedIn Scraping
**Component:** Scout Agent
**Limit:** LinkedIn has strict anti-scraping measures.
**Impact:** May need to use official API or specialized scraping services if direct scraping fails.
**Planned Fix:** Monitor success rate; consider BrightData or similar if blocked.

### Limitation 2: Vercel Serverless Timeouts
**Component:** API
**Limit:** Vercel functions timeout after 10-60s.
**Impact:** Cannot run long-running agents (Scout/Barometer) on Vercel.
**Workaround:** Run agents locally/Docker; use Vercel only for Gatekeeper API.
