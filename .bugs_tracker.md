## ✅ Resolved Bugs

### BUGS-F01: Fly.io Restart Loop (Worker Mode)
**Status:** Resolved
**Priority:** High
**Severity:** Major
**Found:** Feb 2026
**Fixed:** Feb 2026

**Problem:**
Fly.io machines were restarting frequently ("Machines Restarting a Lot").

**Root Cause:**
1. **Run-and-Done:** The worker script (`main.py`) finished its task and exited (exit code 0). Fly.io interpreted this as a crash and restarted it.
2. **Health Check Failure:** Fly.io was trying to perform HTTP smoke checks on a worker process that had no open ports.
3. **App Name Typo:** `fly.toml` had `burns-barometer` instead of `burnsbaramator`.

**Solution:**
1. **Keep-Alive Loop:** Updated `main.py` to run in a `while True` loop when `CLOUD_MODE=true`.
2. **Worker Mode:** Removed `[[services]]` block from `fly.toml` to disable HTTP health checks.
3. **Config Fix:** Corrected app name in `fly.toml`.
4. **Memory:** Increased VM memory to 1GB to support Playwright/WeasyPrint.

## ⚠️ Known Limitations (Not Bugs)

### Limitation 1: LinkedIn Scraping
**Component:** Scout Agent
**Limit:** LinkedIn has strict anti-scraping measures.
**Impact:** May need to use official API or specialized scraping services if direct scraping fails.
**Planned Fix:** Monitor success rate; consider BrightData or similar if blocked.
