## ✅ Resolved Bugs

### BUGS-R02: Vercel Build Configuration Mismatch
**Status:** Resolved
**Priority:** High
**Severity:** Blocker
**Found:** Feb 2026
**Fixed:** Feb 2026

**Problem:**
Vercel deployment failed due to mismatch between `uv.lock` (Python 3.12) and `pyproject.toml` (Python 3.11), and missing explicit build command.

**Root Cause:**
- `uv` locally used Python 3.12, but Vercel config didn't enforce it.
- Vercel didn't know whether to use `pip` or `uv` for install.

**Solution:**
1. Updated `vercel.json` to explicitly use `pip install -r requirements.txt` and set runtime to Python 3.11 (to match Dockerfile/local).
2. Updated `pyproject.toml` to include ALL dependencies.
3. Added `.vercelignore` to reduce build size.

**Lessons Learned:**
- Explicitly define `buildCommand` in `vercel.json` to avoid ambiguity.
- Use `.vercelignore` to prevent uploading unnecessary files (docs, tests, DBs).

### BUGS-R01: Vercel Deployment Failure (ModuleNotFoundError)
**Status:** Resolved  
**Priority:** High  
**Severity:** Blocker  
**Found:** Feb 2026  
**Fixed:** Feb 2026  

**Problem:**
Vercel deployment failed with `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'fastapi'`.

**Root Cause:**
Vercel detected `pyproject.toml` and `uv.lock` but `dependencies` in `pyproject.toml` was empty. Vercel prioritized this over `requirements.txt`, resulting in no packages being installed.

**Solution:**
1. Updated `pyproject.toml` to include `fastapi`, `uvicorn`, and other core dependencies.
2. Simplified `vercel.json` to use modern Zero Config rewrites.

**Lessons Learned:**
- Always ensure `pyproject.toml` dependencies are synced if the file exists.
- Vercel's build system prioritizes modern packaging tools (`uv`/`poetry`) over `requirements.txt`.

## 🔍 Bug Patterns Identified

### Pattern 1: Dependency Management Conflicts
**Occurrences:** 2
**Components Affected:** Deployment (Vercel)
**Pattern:** Dual dependency files (`requirements.txt` vs `pyproject.toml`) causing build confusion.
**Solution:** Keep them in sync or stick to one source of truth for specific environments.

## 🔧 Common Fixes Reference

### Fix 1: Vercel Build Issues
If Vercel build fails on dependencies:
1. Check if `pyproject.toml` exists.
2. If yes, ensure `dependencies` list is populated.
3. Delete `uv.lock` to force regeneration.

## ⚠️ Known Limitations (Not Bugs)

### Limitation 1: LinkedIn Scraping
**Component:** Scout Agent
**Limit:** LinkedIn has strict anti-scraping measures.
**Impact:** May need to use official API or specialized scraping services if direct scraping fails.
**Planned Fix:** Monitor success rate; consider BrightData or similar if blocked.

### Limitation 2: Vercel Serverless Timeouts
**Component:** API
**Limit:** Vercel functions timeout after 10-60s.
**Impact:** Cannot run long-running agents (Scout/Barometer) on Vercel.
**Workaround:** Run agents locally/Docker; use Vercel only for Gatekeeper API.
