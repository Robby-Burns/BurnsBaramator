## ✅ Resolved Bugs

### BUGS-R06: Vercel Deployment Size Limit Exceeded
**Status:** Resolved
**Priority:** High
**Severity:** Blocker
**Found:** Feb 2026
**Fixed:** Feb 2026

**Problem:**
Vercel deployment failed because the unzipped function size exceeded 250MB. This was caused by heavy dependencies (`playwright`, `weasyprint`, `langchain`) included in the build.

**Solution:**
1. Created `requirements-vercel.txt` with only minimal API dependencies (`fastapi`, `sqlalchemy`, etc.).
2. Updated `vercel.json` to install from this lighter file.
3. Updated `.vercelignore` to exclude `agents/` and other heavy directories not needed for the API.

### BUGS-R05: Vercel Build Command Conflict
**Status:** Resolved
**Priority:** High
**Severity:** Blocker
**Found:** Feb 2026
**Fixed:** Feb 2026

**Problem:**
Vercel build failed with `error: externally-managed-environment`.

**Solution:**
Simplified `vercel.json` to use `{"framework": "fastapi"}` (initially) and then switched to explicit `pip install -r requirements-vercel.txt` to control dependencies.

### BUGS-R04: API Database Connection Failure
**Status:** Resolved
**Priority:** High
**Severity:** Major
**Found:** Feb 2026
**Fixed:** Feb 2026

**Problem:**
`api/index.py` failed because it used SQLite-specific methods.

**Solution:**
Updated `api/index.py` to use SQLAlchemy methods.

### BUGS-R03: Vercel "Externally Managed Environment" Error
**Status:** Resolved
**Priority:** High
**Severity:** Blocker
**Found:** Feb 2026
**Fixed:** Feb 2026

**Problem:**
Vercel build failed with `error: externally-managed-environment`.

**Solution:**
Removed explicit `buildCommand` initially.

### BUGS-R02: Vercel Build Configuration Mismatch
**Status:** Resolved
**Priority:** High
**Severity:** Blocker
**Found:** Feb 2026
**Fixed:** Feb 2026

**Problem:**
Vercel deployment failed due to mismatch between `uv.lock` and `pyproject.toml`.

**Solution:**
Updated `pyproject.toml`.

### BUGS-R01: Vercel Deployment Failure (ModuleNotFoundError)
**Status:** Resolved  
**Priority:** High  
**Severity:** Blocker  
**Found:** Feb 2026  
**Fixed:** Feb 2026  

**Problem:**
Vercel deployment failed with `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'fastapi'`.

**Solution:**
Populated `pyproject.toml` dependencies.

## 🔍 Bug Patterns Identified

### Pattern 1: Serverless Constraints
**Occurrences:** 2 (Timeouts, Size Limits)
**Components Affected:** Deployment
**Pattern:** Treating Vercel like a VPS leads to failure. Serverless functions have strict size (250MB) and time (10-60s) limits.
**Solution:** Split the architecture. Run heavy agents locally/Docker; deploy only the lightweight API to Vercel.

## 🔧 Common Fixes Reference

## ⚠️ Known Limitations (Not Bugs)

### Limitation 1: LinkedIn Scraping
**Component:** Scout Agent
**Limit:** LinkedIn has strict anti-scraping measures.
**Impact:** May need to use official API or specialized scraping services if direct scraping fails.
**Planned Fix:** Monitor success rate; consider BrightData or similar if blocked.

### Limitation 2: Vercel Serverless Timeouts
**Component:** API
**Limit:** Vercel functions timeout after 10-60s.
**Impact:** Cannot run long-running agents (Scout/Barometer) on Vercel.
**Workaround:** Run agents locally/Docker; use Vercel only for Gatekeeper API.
