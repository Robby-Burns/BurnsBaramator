## ✅ Resolved Bugs

### BUGS-R05: Vercel Build Command Conflict
**Status:** Resolved
**Priority:** High
**Severity:** Blocker
**Found:** Feb 2026
**Fixed:** Feb 2026

**Problem:**
Vercel build failed with `error: externally-managed-environment` because `vercel.json` forced a `pip install` command while the environment was managed by `uv`.

**Solution:**
Simplified `vercel.json` to use `{"framework": "fastapi"}`. This allows Vercel to auto-detect the project structure and use `uv` natively to install dependencies from `pyproject.toml`.

### BUGS-R04: API Database Connection Failure
**Status:** Resolved
**Priority:** High
**Severity:** Major
**Found:** Feb 2026
**Fixed:** Feb 2026

**Problem:**
`api/index.py` failed because it used SQLite-specific methods (`cursor`, `fetchall`) on the new SQLAlchemy-based `DatabaseManager`.

**Solution:**
Updated `api/index.py` to use `db.engine.connect()` and `text()` queries.

### BUGS-R03: Vercel "Externally Managed Environment" Error
**Status:** Resolved
**Priority:** High
**Severity:** Blocker
**Found:** Feb 2026
**Fixed:** Feb 2026

**Problem:**
Vercel build failed with `error: externally-managed-environment` when running `pip install -r requirements.txt`.

**Solution:**
Removed explicit `buildCommand` (initially) and later switched to framework auto-detection.

### BUGS-R02: Vercel Build Configuration Mismatch
**Status:** Resolved
**Priority:** High
**Severity:** Blocker
**Found:** Feb 2026
**Fixed:** Feb 2026

**Problem:**
Vercel deployment failed due to mismatch between `uv.lock` (Python 3.12) and `pyproject.toml` (Python 3.11).

**Solution:**
Updated `pyproject.toml` to include all dependencies and match runtime.

### BUGS-R01: Vercel Deployment Failure (ModuleNotFoundError)
**Status:** Resolved  
**Priority:** High  
**Severity:** Blocker  
**Found:** Feb 2026  
**Fixed:** Feb 2026  

**Problem:**
Vercel deployment failed with `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'fastapi'`.

**Solution:**
Populated `pyproject.toml` dependencies.

## 🔍 Bug Patterns Identified

### Pattern 1: Vercel Build System Evolution
**Occurrences:** 4
**Components Affected:** Deployment
**Pattern:** Vercel's shift to `uv` requires minimal configuration. Explicit `pip` commands often conflict with the managed environment.
**Solution:** Use `{"framework": "fastapi"}` and rely on `pyproject.toml`.

## ⚠️ Known Limitations (Not Bugs)

### Limitation 1: LinkedIn Scraping
**Component:** Scout Agent
**Limit:** LinkedIn has strict anti-scraping measures.
**Impact:** May need to use official API or specialized scraping services if direct scraping fails.
**Planned Fix:** Monitor success rate; consider BrightData or similar if blocked.

### Limitation 2: Vercel Serverless Timeouts
**Component:** API
**Limit:** Vercel functions timeout after 10-60s.
**Impact:** Cannot run long-running agents (Scout/Barometer) on Vercel.
**Workaround:** Run agents locally/Docker; use Vercel only for Gatekeeper API.
